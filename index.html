    <h1>Leadership, Bottlenecks, and Growing Great Teams</h1>

    <p>
      People in a team usually accept tasks when a leader assigns them. However,
      acceptance does not always translate into ownership or execution.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Are you the bottleneck in your team?</strong></p>

    <p>
      If you are the bottleneck, you may appear to be a strong leader—but in
      reality, this is a warning sign.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bottleneck Problem</h2>

    <p>
      When every decision depends on a single leader or architect, that person
      becomes a single point of failure. While this may feel like control, it
      limits team growth and scalability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some people avoid risk even when they know the solution. Others use
      bottleneck power for job security by withholding information, controlling
      access, and making themselves indispensable.
    </p>

    <h2>A Common Leadership Mistake</h2>

    <p>
      Early in leadership, many believe that protecting the team is the right
      approach—acting as a “superman” so the team can work peacefully.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Writing code for the team</li>
      <li>Making all decisions alone</li>
      <li>Shielding the team from challenges</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Over time, this results in stagnant skills, comfort zones, and a lack of
      learning. This is the easiest way to be a leader—and the wrong one.
    </p>

    <h2>The True Role of a Leader</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Your role as a leader is to make yourself unnecessary.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      A successful leader removes themselves as a bottleneck by enabling others
      to solve problems independently.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are always busy, it often means you are solving the same problems
      repeatedly for different people.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      By growing others, you will always have a job.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Coaching Instead of Solving</h2>

    <p>
      Instead of solving problems for the team, solve problems together.
      Share your thought process so others can learn how to approach similar
      challenges.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Grant decision-making authority</li>
      <li>Coach people to make decisions</li>
      <li>Challenge them to solve problems themselves</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If leaders solve everything, the team never learns—and eventually stops
      trusting or depending on them.
    </p>

    <h2>Developing Individual Skills</h2>

    <p>
      Leaders must identify skill gaps, coach team members, and teach them how to
      face real-world challenges. Trust and responsibility are key drivers of
      growth.
    </p>

    <h2>Great Teams Are Grown, Not Hired</h2>

    <blockquote>
      “Great teams are grown, not hired.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Perfect teams do not exist. Teams are built from individuals with diverse
      backgrounds, experience levels, and perspectives. The leader’s role is to
      transform this group into a high-performing team.
    </p>

    <h2>Building a Team of Leaders</h2>

    <p>
      Create a team of leaders who work and grow together. When people are stuck,
      ask questions instead of providing answers immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if the leader knows the solution, allowing the team to think and
      propose solutions leads to deeper learning.
    </p>

    <h2>Leadership Is Hard</h2>

    <p>
      Leadership done right is difficult—and that is why it matters.
      Taking responsibility, facing people directly, and continuously challenging
      the team are the hardest parts of leadership.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning and Growth Phases</h2>

    <p>
      Teams grow through three phases:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Survival</li>
      <li>Learning</li>
      <li>Self-organizing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Moving from survival to learning mode is challenging, but essential for
      long-term success.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Growing the team is our responsibility, our risk, our challenge, and our growth.
    </blockquote>
